Polybar is a beautiful bar but in some cases for example if you have a small screen it might take too much space so I've made a simple script that hide Polybar when there are windows in the current workspace, the script shows the bar if you move the cursor where the bar is or if you don't have any windows in the workspace that you're using.

## How to Install
1. Clone the git repo in your home: 
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/arkeane/polybar_autohide.git ~/polybar_autohide
     ```
     - Install nedeed software: `polybar` `xdotool` `xdo`

2. Move to the script directory `cd ~/polybar_autohide`
     
3. Make adjustments to the script
     - You can adjust settings in the source code

4. Compile the script `make`

5. Autostart the script
     - Add the `autohide` file to your autostart system
          - If you use i3wm add this to your config file, change $USER with your username:
               ```
               exec --no-startup-id /home/$USER/polybar_autohide/polybar-autohide
               ```
          - If not just use your usual autostart system.
